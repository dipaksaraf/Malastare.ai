## About Time Series Analysis
Time Series is one of the most commonly used phenomena in data science. It has a wide variety of applications ranging from weather forecasting, predicting sales to analyzing year on
year trends, etc. This dataset is specific to the time series and the challenge here is to forecast sales/demand for the next 6 months

## Business overview

Global Mart is an online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office

## Business domain

(e-commerce, retail, etc)

## Business Insights

The sales/operations manager, want to finalise the plan for the next 6 months.  So, she want to forecast the sales and the demand for the next 6 months, that would help manage the revenue and inventory accordingly
 
The store caters to 7 different market segments and in 3 major categories. She want to forecast at this granular level, so she has subset the data into 21 (7*3) buckets prior to providing the data for analysis

## Problem statement

To forecast the sales/demand for next 6 months using Time Series Analysis

## 3 ways supermarkets are using your data
Big data is everywhere and being collected by almost every consumer facing business. Your regular supermarket knows more about you than you think. For many supermarket brands gaining customer loyalty is incredibly important, as competition only grows. To ensure they are retaining their customers and getting new business, many shops now use big data to understand and target their audience in the right way.

How is the big data collected by supermarkets used to improve your shopping experience?

### Loyalty Schemes
If you shop at any of the major supermarkets the likelihood is you will belong to at least one (if not many) of the loyalty schemes, from Tesco’s Clubcard or Sainsbury’s Nectar Card. These schemes allow the supermarket to collect data on you every time you shop and swipe. By tracking these shopping habits (what you buy, when you buy, and how much you buy) the shops are able to target specific promotions or vouchers at you. This data can also be a great way for the supermarket to understand market trends and pricing.

This same data is also being used on your digital shop, the shops are tracking what you buy so they can offer recommended products and tailor adverts to suit you.

### Customer Experience
Big data is also helping to improve customer service and experience when interacting directly with these brands. As with any business supermarkets receive complaints and compliments each day. By tracking these comments and analysing the data from them, supermarkets can learn where to improve, what products may be having issues and even how to make sure they retain existing customers. Many of the stores will also have multiple departments, by collecting the data they can ensure their ‘profile’ on you is in one place and your experience is seamless.

### Not just about the customer
Big data can also help the supermarkets predict shopping trends and buyer habits. This data helps the store not just know what to stock but how to place them in the store, for example if two products are typically bought together should they be placed in the same, or near, aisles?

Big data is really changing the way we do our weekly shops, whether we realised it or not. I’m excited to see how this will continue to develop as the amount of data collected is only going to grow.


Our 6 Step Problem Solving Roadmap


Gain the best results in solving complex and important problems. We-Do!

### Step 1: Identify the problem
At this stage, you are defining the scope of the problem you have to solve. Points to consider at this stage include: problem origin (if known), problem impact (e.g. on customers, on staff or reputation) and timeline to solve the problem.

Note: the time factor is important to consider because it influences how much time you can dedicate to thinking through the problem. In extreme conditions, you may run through this entire process in less than an hour.

### Step 2: Structure the problem
Putting the problem into a clear structure for analysis is one of the great insights we bring to our work. What does it mean to structure a problem? It means identifying the important issues.

### Step 3: Develop solutions
According to research by Chip and Dan Heath in their book “Decisive,” most managers develop only two solutions: “Do x or do not do X.” It will come as no surprise that this approach rarely delivers success. Binary choices tend to have a 50% or greater failure rate. On the other hand, fifty solutions is probably too many to handle especially if you are working through a problem solving process on your own.

The Solution Sweet Spot: developing three to five solutions is usually enough.

### Step 4: Select a solution to the problem
With a list of possible solutions on the table, it is now time to decide. 
Note: For large scale problem solving, you may have to follow an organizational template or policy if your solution requires a large amount of money.

### Step 5: Implement a solution
In this step, you put the solution into action. Implementation may become a project of its own. In that case, you have a full toolkit of project management tools and processes to call on.

Tip: If you are solving a novel problem, stay humble about your solution. It may not work or there may be a better way.

### Step 6: Monitor for success
Monitoring the solution and situation is a key step to ensure the problem is truly solved. Failing to follow up – especially if you have assigned the task to someone else – is a recipe for disaster. 

Monitoring is also important because problems are sometimes symptom of a deeper problem.

Tip: Increase the quantity and frequency of reporting when you are working through an important problem.
